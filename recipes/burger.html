        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A burger is the american version of a sandwich. It is normally made when the sun is out.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class = "ingredients">
            <li class = "nonVegan">Meat</li>
            <li>Bread</li>
            <li>Greens</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Fry your meat in a pan. Make sure to cook it through, or you may get ill.</li>
            <li>Toast your bread in the same pan that you cooked the meat in. This step is not entirely necessary, but it is how they do it in the movies.</li>
            <li>Construct your burger. First lay down some bread, then meat, then greens, then more bread.</li>
            <li>An additional optional step is to then add some cheese to your burger. This is then called a cheeseburger.</li>
        </ol>
